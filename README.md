This repository contains the molecular similarity investigation of nine distinct microbes based on KEGG microorganism codes. Each of the 9 folders corresponds to a specific microbe and contains:

  .mol files for four pharmaceuticals: Atenolol, Carbamazepine (negative control), Ibuprofen, and Sulfamethoxazole.
  Metabolites produced by the corresponding bacteria.
  .kgml files generated via an automated retrieval script.
  Molecular Similarity scripts (for each pharmaceutical: ate, cmp, ibp, smx).
  8 Excel files (.xlsx): Two for each pharmaceutical, showing similarity scores sorted by ascending and descending Tanimoto similarity.
Note: Python scripts may be found at the bottom of folders as they are sorted alphabetically by filename.

Additionally, the file combined_analysis.xlsx contains all relevant graphs and tables for the project. It is available as a raw download and provides a comprehensive analysis overview.
